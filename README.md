# Request Results Management in Flutter

This project introduces a custom solution for efficiently handling request results in Flutter applications. Leveraging the `Either` abstraction, the system elegantly manages both success and failure scenarios, allowing for detailed handling of each case. Additionally, it includes a robust global error management system to ensure a seamless user experience without interruptions.
